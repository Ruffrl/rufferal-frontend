// Referenced projects must have the new composite setting enabled. This setting is needed to ensure TypeScript can quickly determine where to find the outputs of the referenced project. Enabling the composite flag changes a few things:

// The rootDir setting, if not explicitly set, defaults to the directory containing thetsconfig file
// All implementation files must be matched by an include pattern or listed in the files array. If this constraint is violated, tsc will inform you which files werenâ€™t specified
// declaration must be turned on
