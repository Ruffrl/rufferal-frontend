/* [ATOMS] ATOMIC DESIGN
 *
 * ⚠️ Please prefix all Atoms with 'R' to differentiate between native elements
 *
 * Atoms are the most basic elements of a user interface
 *
 * These are the fundamental building blocks that cannot be broken down any further without losing their meaning
 * Examples of atoms include:
 *   Buttons: <button />
 *   Input Fields: <input />
 *   Labels: <label />
